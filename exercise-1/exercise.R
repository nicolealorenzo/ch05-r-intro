# Exercise-1: practice with basic syntax

# Create a variable `hometown` that stores the city in which you were born

hometown <- "St. Louis"

# Assign your name to the variable `my.name`
my.name <- "Nicole Lorenzo"

# Assign your height to a variable `my.height`
my.height <- "5'6"

# Create a variable `puppies` equal to the number of puppies you'd like to have
puppies <- 1


# Create a variable `puppy.price`, which is how expensive you think a puppy is
puppy.price <- 1000

# Create a variable `total.cost` that has the total cost of all of your puppies

total.cost <- puppies * puppy.price

# Create a boolean variable `too.expensive`, set to true if the cost is greater than $1,000
too.expensive <- total.cost > 1000

# Create a variable `max_puppies`, which is the number of puppies you can afford for $1K.  Compute this
# value in R, not just assign!

max.puppies <- 1000/puppy.price
